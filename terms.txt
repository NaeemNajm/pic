TERMS, CONDITIONS & DECLARATION (শর্তাবলী ও ঘোষণা)
By accepting this invoice, the client confirms that they have read, understood, and agreed to the following terms and conditions:

1. Booking & Payment Policy:

For Packages: An advance payment of 50% of the total package price is required to confirm the booking. The remaining 50% balance must be paid within 24 hours of visa issuance notification.

We kindly request our clients to be prepared to make this final payment promptly upon notification. Further processes, such as airline ticketing, are highly time-sensitive. To secure the best available flights and prices, it may become necessary to issue tickets immediately, which can require payment even at night or on public holidays. Your preparedness in this matter is highly appreciated.

For Individual Services: Full advance payment is mandatory for individual services such as Visa Processing or Air Ticketing. No services will be rendered until the full payment is received.

All payments must be made through the official bank accounts or channels mentioned in this invoice.

2. Cancellation & Refund Policy:

Written Request: All cancellation requests must be submitted in a formal written manner (e.g., email).

Visa Fee: The visa processing fee is strictly non-refundable under all circumstances.

Supplier Policies: Refunds for air tickets, hotel bookings, and transport are strictly subject to the respective supplier's (airline, hotel, etc.) cancellation policies.

Special Condition for Group Air Tickets: For group packages, seats are secured with airlines through a block booking commitment made long before the travel date. Consequently, even if the individual ticket has not been issued, cancellations made after the airline's penalty deadline (typically 15-21 days before departure) will result in the air ticket portion of the package becoming partially or fully non-refundable, as per the airline's group policy. The company is not liable for this amount.

Refund Processing Time: Approved refunds will be processed only after the company receives the payment back from the relevant suppliers. This process typically takes 30 to 90 working days but may be extended depending on the supplier's own processing timelines. The client agrees to this duration.

Refund Processing Fee: A refund processing fee of BDT 2,000 per person or 3% of the refundable amount, whichever is greater, will be deducted from the refund amount for each cancellation.

No-Show: If a client fails to appear for a flight, tour, or at a hotel on the scheduled date, it will be considered a "No-Show," and no refund will be provided.

Partial Utilization: No refund will be provided for any partially utilized services (e.g., leaving a tour midway).

Mode of Refund: All refunds will be processed through the original mode of payment (e.g., bank transfer to the same account).

Credit Note Option: As an alternative to a cash refund, the client may opt to receive a credit note for the refundable amount. This credit can be used for any future service from Al-Hikmah Tour & Travels within a specified validity period.

3. External Factors & Government Regulations:

The company reserves the right to alter, delay, or cancel any tour due to changes in regulations by the Saudi government or the government of Bangladesh, or due to other unavoidable circumstances (Force Majeure).

In such an event, the company will offer alternative options. If the client is unable to accept the alternatives, cancellation will be subject to the standard refund policy, considering all non-refundable costs.

4. Air Ticket Policy for Group Bookings:

We understand that receiving your air ticket well in advance provides peace of mind. For our group packages, the process is slightly different for the benefit of the entire group, and we appreciate your understanding.

Finalized group tickets are typically issued one day prior to departure. The reason for this is that group tickets (often for 30-40 passengers at once) are highly restrictive. Once the final passenger names are submitted to the airline, they become strictly non-changeable and non-refundable.

To protect our clients from losing their entire ticket value due to an unforeseen emergency (like a sudden illness or a passport issue), we submit the final names to the airline at the latest possible time. If we were to finalize tickets weeks in advance, it would be impossible to accommodate any last-minute passenger changes. This policy, while it seems late, is a safeguard to provide maximum flexibility and security for all travelers in the group.

Please be assured that your travel is secure. A tentative flight schedule will be provided when the group is formed, and we guarantee the confirmed ticket will be delivered to you before your flight.

5. Tour Conduct & Service Expectations:

Service Quality: The company commits to providing services (e.g., hotels, transport) as described in the official invoice and package itinerary. Any pictures used in promotional materials are for illustrative purposes; the actual service specifications will be as per the final itinerary.

Client Conduct: Clients are expected to maintain courteous behavior towards all staff and fellow travelers. Patience is required during unforeseen delays.

First Day & Check-in/Check-out: Please be prepared for potential logistical adjustments on the first day. Standard hotel check-in time is 2:00 PM. Arriving early may require waiting. Standard check-out time is also 2:00 PM, even for late-night flights.

Room Arrangement: Accommodation is typically arranged with four persons per room. However, the company reserves the right to adjust bed arrangements based on hotel configuration and group size. We request your kind cooperation in this matter to ensure the best possible solution for everyone.

Service Reviews: We welcome your valuable feedback at any stage of your journey. To help us get a complete picture and continuously improve, we encourage you to share a comprehensive review after the full tour is completed.

6. Service Adjustments:

The financial responsibility for any service adjustments will lie solely with the client. This includes bearing the cost for any services added at the client's request, as well as being entitled to a refund for any services removed for the client's benefit. All refunds in such cases will be subject to our standard Cancellation & Refund Policy.

7. Company's Responsibility:

The company is responsible for providing the services as contracted in the invoice and itinerary. In the event of a significant error or failure to provide a confirmed service due to the company's direct negligence, our liability will be limited to either providing a suitable alternative of a similar standard or offering a refund for the specific portion of the service that was not delivered. The company shall not be held liable for any indirect or consequential loss or damage to the client.

8. Entire Agreement:

This document, along with the official invoice and package itinerary provided by the company, constitutes the entire agreement between the client and Al-Hikmah Tour & Travels. It supersedes all prior oral or written communications, representations, or agreements between the parties. No sales agent or employee has the authority to promise any service or condition that is not documented herein.

9. Client's Declaration & Agreement:

"I, the undersigned client, hereby declare that I have thoroughly reviewed all the terms and conditions mentioned above. I understand that Al-Hikmah Tour & Travels reserves the right to change or modify any part of the package due to unavoidable circumstances, and I agree that in such an event, the company will provide an alternative of an equal or superior standard. I willingly agree to these conditions and accept all associated risks."
